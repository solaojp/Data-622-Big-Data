# Data-622-Big-data

The project contains five files,

requirements.txt (1 point) This file documents all dependencies needed on top of the existing packages in the Docker Dataquest image from HW1. When called upon using pip install -r requirements.txt , this will install all python packages needed to run the .py files. (hint: use pip freeze to generate the .txt file)

pull_data.py (5 points) When this is called using python pull_data.py in the command line, this will go to the 2 Kaggle urls provided below, authenticate using your own Kaggle sign on, pull the two datasets, and save as .csv files in the current local directory. The authentication login details (aka secrets) need to be in a hidden folder (hint: use .gitignore). There must be a data check step to ensure the data has been pulled correctly and clear commenting and documentation for each step inside the .py file. Training dataset url: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/train.csv Scoring dataset url: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/test.csv

train_model.py (5 points) When this is called using python train_model.py in the command line, this will take in the training dataset csv, perform the necessary data cleaning and imputation, and fit a classification model to the dependent Y. There must be data check steps and clear commenting for each step inside the .py file. The output for running this file is the random forest model saved as a .pkl file in the local directory. Remember that the thought process and decision for why you chose the final model must be clearly documented in this section. eda.ipynb (0 points)

[Optional] This supplements the commenting inside train_model.py. This is the place to provide scratch work and plots to convince me why you did certain data imputations and manipulations inside the train_model.py file.

score_model.py (2 points) When this is called using python score_model.py in the command line, this will ingest the .pkl random forest file and apply the model to the locally saved scoring dataset csv. There must be data check steps and clear commenting for each step inside the .py file. The output for running this file is a csv file with the predicted score, as well as a png or text file output that contains the model accuracy report (e.g. sklearn's classification report or any other way of model evaluation).
